# Unbrowse ðŸš€

**Turn your browser interactions into reusable AI tool calls.**

Unbrowse is a smart browser launcher that learns how your browser interacts with web APIs, turning these interactions into reusable AI-powered abilities. You can then use these abilities directly within the built-in agent or connect them via Model Context Protocol (MCP) to your favorite MCP-compatible clients (like Cursor IDE).

## How does it work?

1. **Connect to Chrome**
   - Launch Unbrowse and press the **power button** to connect it to your Chrome browser.

2. **Browse Normally**
   - Navigate to the website you want Unbrowse to learn from.

3. **Teach Abilities**
   - Tell Unbrowse explicitly to learn abilities from the current website. It will automatically identify and store interactions as reusable tool calls.

4. **Use Learned Abilities**
   - Prompt the built-in agent or connect via MCP clients (like Cursor IDE) to use these learned abilities, automating your browsing tasks effortlessly.
