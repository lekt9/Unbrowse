# >be me, tired of manual browsing  
# >create Unbrowse, browser launcher that learns API interactions  
# >turns websites into tool calls, MCP-style  
# >abilities learned once, shared across all users (credentials stored locally tho)  
# >finally automate browsing tasks and debug sites like a chad  

## >how to use this thing

>browse your target website normally  
>tell Unbrowse to learn abilities from the site you're on  
>now prompt your agent to use these abilities (tool calls ftw)  
>connect cursor IDE or other MCP clients to Unbrowse MCP for max comfy  

## >regular use cases (normie mode)  
>automate boring research like stock info, options, earnings data, etc.  

## >MCP use cases (dev mode)
